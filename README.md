  <h2> About </h2>
  <p>  Im a 2nd year Masters student in Signal and image processing at NIT Rourkela
       previously i received my bachelors in robotics and automation engineering .
       i have worked on image classification, image segmentation , video object segmentation
       and my current research interest is Thermal Video super Resolution based on Swin Transformers. 
       I have done a literature survey on power of transformers in nlp, vision and multimodal tasks, 
       and i conclude transformers are everything . Im open to collaborations and discussion regarding 
       power of transformers .
